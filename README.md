# skytrack-vfr
SkyTrack VFR is a simple android navigation app which lets you construct point-to-point routes with custom waypoints. It displays the active route on a latitude-longitude map along with your current GPS-derived position and direction of travel.

The app was designed to accompany pilots using official VFR charts by providing the one extra piece of information your chart can't tell you - your actual position. The map display doesn't include any airspace or terrain information, but this shouldn't be needed if you've planned and drawn your route on an up-to-date map.

I've never distributed SkyTrack VFR on any app stores since there are many feature-rich flight navigation apps already out there, and this was always just a limited use hobby project I created during my time as a student pilot.

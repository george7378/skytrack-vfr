# skytrackvfr
SkyTrack VFR is a simple android app which allows you to construct point-to-point routes with custom waypoints. It displays the active route on a simple latitude-longitude map along with your current GPS-derived position and direction of travel.

The app was intended to accompany pilots using official VFR charts by providing the one extra piece of information your chart can't tell you - your actual position. The map display doesn't include any airspace or terrain information, but this shouldn't be needed as long as you have planned/drawn your route on an up-to-date map.

I haven't uploaded this app to the play store as I feel there are already many superior aviation apps out there, and I wouldn't want people to measure my simple tool against the professional planning/nav apps which already exist. This was a hobby project I created during my time as a student pilot.
